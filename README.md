**Simple Linear Regression
**


Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. The red line in the above graph is referred to as the best fit straight line. Based on the given data points, we try to plot a line that models the points the best. The line can be modelled based on the linear equation shown below.

y=b0+b1x    

b0=intercept  

b1=slope

OLS-Ordinary least square

Rsq=1-sum of square of Residual/sum of square of Total           

Rsq-Co-efficient of deternination
r-correlation co-efficient

Rsq-range between 0-1
r-range between -1 to +1

root(R)=r
if r=-1 then -ve perfect linear relation
if r=+1 then +ve perfect linear relation
